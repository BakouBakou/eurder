Story 1:
Should we perform any specific checks on the user input for creation of a customer?
- what are the mandatory fields
email -> unique -> string@string.string
first name
name
address
- are there formatting/length constraints
only for email

Story 2:
Should we perform any specific checks on the user input for creation of an item?
- what are the mandatory fields
all of them
- are there formatting/length constraints
- can the stock be negative (ex: customer ordered it but it is not in stock, so we put -1 in the stock)
no, 0 or more

Story 3:
Is this understanding correct?
- An order has at least one item group
- An item group contains only 1 specific type of item (specific item ID) -> sum?
yes

- An order can only be finalized once every item group has been delivered
 -> either "delete" item groups shipped from the order when they are delivered
 -> or wait for the entire ordered to be shipped
 -> or link item groups to and order id and handle item groups instead of orders

 - Endpoint
 POST /customers/{id}/order/
 user input should contain one or multiple item groups with:
 - item id (must exist in DB)
 - amount (int, > 0)

Story 7:
Does it mean return all the information from all the customers when the request is performed?
yes

Story 8:
What identifier will the admin use to look for the customer? An existing value (ex: mail) or an ID generated by the system?
generate an ID
